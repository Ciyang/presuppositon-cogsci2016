In this paper, we introduced a probabilistic model in the RSA framework, 
which analyzes the projective content of change-of-state verbs 
 under negation as the result of the listener using general conversational principles to jointly infer the actual world and the context set that the speaker assumes
%, without special semantic treatment of projective content.
The model predicts an interaction between projection and the question under discussion, formalizing 
 insights of previous pragmatic approach to projection and providing 
 concrete quantitative predictions that we plan to test experimentally. 

 
Our model is a first step towards a full integration of pragmatic 
 approach to the projection problem into a general probabilistic model
 of language understanding. We plan to further explore the model and 
  see to what extent it can be generalized to
  other types of projective content and other entailment-canceling
  operators, which will help us further understand the division of labor 
  between semantics and pragmatics in the projection phenomena.

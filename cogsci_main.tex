\begin{abstract}
Certain content of a linguistic construction can project when the construction is embedded in entailment-canceling environments.
 For example, the conclusion that John smoked in the past from the utterance \emph{John stopped smoking} 
 still holds for \emph{John didn't stop smoking}, in which the original utterance is 
 embedded under negation. 
 There are two main approaches to account for projection phenomena. 
 The semantic approach adds restrictions of the common ground to the conventional meaning.
 The pragmatic approach tries to derive projection from general conversational principles. 
 In this paper, using the rational speech-act theory, we build a probabilistic model in which the listener 
  jointly infers the world and the common ground from the speaker's perspective. 
 We take change-of-state verbs as an example and model its projective content under negation. 
 The model predicts the projective behavior and its interaction with 
  the \emph{question under discussion} (QUD), under certain assumptions of the 
  common ground prior and the default QUD for change-of-state verbs.
